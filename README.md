This is the ongoing project on moving from Xamarin to Flutter.

To get started please refer to the Flutter website, for now.

## Todo's
- Tests on RouteBuilder.
- Tests on Application-screen/BLoC.
- Tests on BlocProviderTree & BlocProvider.
- A fully intergrated BloC.
- API still misses some features.
- API should support unsuccessfull calls to the back-end
- API should expose backend error messages to the BLoC, such that it cna be communicated to the users.
- Actually good looking and well functional views.

## Branching rules
When creating a new branch for this project. One should stay on the Weekplanner-repository. To name a new branch use the `flutter/`-prefix. Otherwise just like normal.
